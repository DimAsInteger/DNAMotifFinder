# DNAMotifFinder

DNAMotifFinder uses several regex functions to perform Java pattern matching to retrieve 2 specified DNA sequences or motifs from 3000 training sequences.  
The result outputs both motif sequences, their  regions within the submitted DNA training sequence, sequence lengths, a start codon and it’s corresponding location 
within the sequence motif, the query sequence,  the query sequence’s reverse compliment, %GC content, total number of characters, and character frequencies and probabilities.
